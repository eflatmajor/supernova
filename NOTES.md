# Rooms

- Doors (entrances/exits) to the N, E, S and/or W.
- Containers (chests/barrels etc.), that can contain preset and/or randomised loot.
- Terminals (computers), to ack doors/security/enemy robots/whatever.
- NPCs, with quests/dialogue.
- Textual "cutscenes", such as for when you first enter a new area.

# Commands

- walk / move / travel / go <direction> - Move to other rooms.
- describe <entity> - Gives some flavour text / lore about a thing in the room.
- look / search / find
- use
- equip / unequip
- pickup / drop

## UI

It might be cool/useful to allow commands to specify a Vue component that is rendered into the command history area, so we could have different kinds of output, to make things
more visually interesting, or just more usable.
